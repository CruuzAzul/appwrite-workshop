::: info ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial Configuration
Ensure that your application is correctly configured to interact with Appwrite's server-side SDK before you start
managing users. If you've followed the configuration steps in
the [Configuration](/workshop/configuration/appwrite-configuration) section, you're ready to proceed üìù.

<InfoBonus title="Account vs Users">

The **Account** API is the one you should use in your client applications with Client SDKs like web, Flutter, mobile,
and native applications. The Account API creates sessions, which represent an authenticated user and are attached to a
user's account. Sessions respect permissions, meaning users can only access resources if they have the appropriate
permissions.

The **Users** API is dedicated to user management from an administrator's perspective. It should be used with backend or
server-side applications equipped with server SDKs. The Users API uses API keys instead of sessions. This means they are
not limited by permissions but by the application fields granted to the API key in use.

## Overview of Travelers üìä

In this section, we'll explore how to use Appwrite's server-side SDK to retrieve information about travelers. You'll be
able to see the complete list of travelers, view their profiles, and learn more about them! ü§úüèº ü§õüèº

To get started, we need to initialize our SDK for the **Users** service. Just like for the **Account** service, we'll
import the **Users** service and create a new instance, passing your Appwrite client as a parameter, but also a valid
API key!

## Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Create an API Key

API keys are secrets used by the Appwrite server SDKs and the Appwrite CLI to prove their identity. Access to each API
key is limited by application fields rather than permissions.

:::tip ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practice
It's a good practice to grant an API key only the application fields needed for a specific action. API keys should be
treated as secrets. Never share the API key and keep API keys out of client applications.
:::

Go to the Appwrite console, in the **Overview** section. In the **Integrations** part, click on the **API Keys** tab.
Then click the **Create Key** button. Give your API key a name, specify an expiration date if you wish, and select the
application fields you want to grant to this API key.

:::warning
Do not grant your API key access to all application fields. This could compromise your application's security.

## Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Initialize the Server-Side SDK

To initialize a server-side SDK, we'll create a file `src/api/config/server.config.ts`. This time, we'll import the
Appwrite client not from the client-side SDK but from the server-side SDK.

```ts
import {Client} from 'node-appwrite';

import {EnvConfig} from './env.config';

export const AppwriteClient = new Client()
  .setEndpoint(EnvConfig.endpoint ?? '')
  .setProject(EnvConfig.projectId ?? '')
  .setKey(EnvConfig.apiKey ?? '');
```

:::warning
Please note that even though we initialize our instance with new Client(), it doesn't mean it's a client-side SDK. The
distinction between a client-side and server-side SDK depends on where the SDK is imported and used. In this example,
we're importing it from a Node.js runtime on the server side, using node-appwrite rather than appwrite!

<InfoBonus title="8 Other Server-Side SDKs!">
If you decide to use another server-side language later on, you can do so without any issues. Appwrite offers 9 different server-side SDKs for the following languages:

</InfoBonus>

## Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Retrieve Users

Use the SDK to retrieve the complete list of users registered in your application. To display the list of users, we
already have a page ready to use, which is the /users page of our application. It seems like a piece of code is missing
to display the list of users, right? ü§î

In the src/api/modules/users.ts file, we can complete the getUsersList function to retrieve the list of users.

<Solution>

```ts
import {users} from '@/api/config/server.config'; // TODO: Change name of the import
import {Users} from '@/models/users';

export const getUsersList = async (): Promise<Users> => {
  const {users: usersList} = await users.list<Users>();

  return usersList;
};
```

</Solution>

:::tip
Here, we are using just one method to interact with the Users API, but you can imagine that there are plenty more! You
can find the complete list of available methods in the API documentation. This will enable you to search, block, and
display information related to your users, current sessions, and recent activity logs. You can also use the Users
service to modify user preferences and personal information.
:::

If you have followed the previous steps correctly, you should now see the list of users displayed on the /users page of
your application, with plenty of information about the wonderful individuals who are closely or remotely involved in
this adventure! üéâ

Speaking of adventure, it's time to move on to the next part. There's still plenty more to discover, so head to your
next destination! üèù
