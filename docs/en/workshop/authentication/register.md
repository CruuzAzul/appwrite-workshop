need
to go. But before that, let's find out how to get registered in the list of travelers who have embarked on this
adventure! 🌴 In this section, we will explore the registration process, step by step! Traveler registration is the first
essential step of our journey. With Appwrite, this task is simplified thanks to the Account service, which handles the
entire process. 🏝️"

::: info ⚠️ Initial Configuration
Before you start registering travelers, make sure your application is correctly configured to interact with Appwrite,
and you have completed the sections in the [Configuration](/workshop/configuration/appwrite-configuration) part 📝

## Registering a Traveler 🧳

<br/>

<InfoBonus title="Registration in the Console 📝">
<br/>
Appwrite provides a user interface directly in the console to manage users. 
You can access this Authentication section from the left menu. From this page, you can view the list of registered users, manage their information, or even create new users 🏝️
<br/><br/>

**But we are much more interested in the Appwrite API for managing users. That's why we're going to dive directly into
the code! 🧑🏼‍💻**

</InfoBonus>

In our case, we'll use the Appwrite SDK to register a traveler. From the AppVenture application, you can see that by
going to the registration page `/register`, the form to collect traveler information is already created! 🥳 Unfortunately
for us, it seems to have been damaged, and some **code snippets for communicating with Appwrite are missing**...
**You'll need to fix all that!** 🧑‍🔧

## Step 1️⃣: Initialize the Account Service

Before you can use the Account service, you need to initialize it with your Appwrite client. To do this, you should
import the Account service and create a new instance of it, passing your Appwrite client as a parameter. You can
initialize the Account service in the `src/workshop/api/config/client.config.ts` file.

```js
export const account = new Account(AppwriteClient);
```

<InfoBonus title="3 other client SDKs!">

If later on, you want to use another client-side language, you can do so without any problem. Appwrite offers 3
different client-side SDKs for the following languages:

</InfoBonus>

## Step 2️⃣: Write the Registration Function

- Now that the Account service is initialized, we can complete the `register` function, which you can find in
  the `src/workshop/api/modules/account/account.ts` file. This function takes the traveler's name, email, and password as
  parameters and uses the Appwrite API to perform the registration.

<Solution>

```ts
import {account} from '@/api/config/client.config'; // [!code ++]

const register = async (email: string, password: string, name: string) => {
  try {
    return await account.create(ID.unique(), email, password, name);  // [!code ++]
  } catch (error: any) {
    const appwriteException = error as AppwriteException;  // [!code ++]
    console.error(appwriteException.message);  // [!code ++]
  }
};
```
</Solution>

:::tip 🆔 Generating a Unique Identifier
When you interact with Appwrite during any data creation, it is necessary that your data has a unique identifier. For
this Appwrite provides a utility function `ID.unique()` that allows you to generate a unique identifier. After that, you
can use this identifier to create your data in Appwrite.
:::

:::tip ℹ️ La gestion des erreurs Appwrite
Lorsque vous utilisez les services Appwrite, il est important de gérer les erreurs qui peuvent survenir. Pour cela,
Appwrite vous permet de récupérer les erreurs avec le type `AppwriteException`. Vous pouvez ensuite récupérer le message
ou le code de l'erreur et traiter l'erreur en conséquence dans votre application !
:::

- Once we have retrieved the traveler's session, it is necessary to authenticate them with their credentials because the
  login is not automatic after registration. For this, we need to use the `login` function, which you can find in
  the `src/workshop/api/modules/account/account.ts` file... Unfortunately, this function is not written yet! 🤔 We'll come back to
  this part later!

## Step 3️⃣: Sign Up!

Now that the `register` function is written, you should be able to create your traveler's account! 🥳 The rest of the
code is already written; you just need to go to the registration page `/register` and fill out the form!

## Step 4️⃣: Verify Your Account

After filling out the form, you should be redirected to the login page `/login`. You should also see your user appear in
the list of users in the Appwrite console! 📝 If you see it, then everything has gone well, and you'll be able to
complete the login page in the next step! 🥳
