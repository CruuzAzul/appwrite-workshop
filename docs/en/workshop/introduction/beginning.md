## About Appwrite 📰

Appwrite was born out of the need for a high-performance, easy-to-use open-source backend solution. Its creator, Eldad
A. Fux, was inspired by the open-source community and the desire to provide developers with a powerful tool to simplify
backend feature management. Since its inception, Appwrite has experienced rapid growth, becoming a major player in the
developer ecosystem and a real alternative to Firebase, offering a multitude of services for building robust web and
mobile applications 💪🏼

## Adventure Awaits You! 🏁

Now that we know a bit more, your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to traverse the world of Appwrite through
different modules located at unique destinations.

Each module hides puzzles and challenges that you will need to solve to progress! These challenges will guide you to a
secret place that could reveal an incredible location and treasure. Here is the map we found at the beginning of the
adventure; let's keep it for later, as we might need it 🫢
