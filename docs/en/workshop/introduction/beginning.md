### About Appwrite 📰

A. Fux, was inspired by the open-source community and the desire to provide developers with a powerful tool to simplify
backend feature management. Since its inception, Appwrite has experienced rapid growth, becoming a major player in the
developer ecosystem and a real alternative to Firebase, offering a multitude of services for building robust web and
mobile applications 💪🏼
