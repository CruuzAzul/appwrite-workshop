## Launching and Configuring the AppVenture 🚀

Now that you have an idea of the importance of the AppVenture, here's how to launch and configure it:

**1.** Fork the [AppVenture repository](https://app-appwrite-workshop-cruzazul.vercel.app/en) from GitHub 🥳

**2.** Install dependencies by running `pnpm install` 📦

:::tip
If you don't have pnpm installed, you can do so by running `npm install -g pnpm` or following the
[installation instructions](https://pnpm.io/en/installation) on the official pnpm website.
:::

**3.** Create a `.env.local` file at the project's root and configure the necessary environment variables using the
information you obtained when creating your Appwrite Cloud instance. Copy the
contents of `.env.example` into `.env.local”; we'll fill in the values later.

**4.** Launch the application using `pnpm dev`.

And there you have it! You're now ready to set off on your adventure with the AppVenture as your loyal companion 😎
