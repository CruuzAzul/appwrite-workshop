## Step 1️⃣: Choose the Gitpod Provider 🤖

To start the Gitpod configuration process, you need to
visit [the self-hosting section of the documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/advanced/self-hosting#one-click-setups")
and click on the Gitpod installation link.

## Step 2️⃣: Create a Gitpod Account 👤

If you don't already have one, start by creating a Gitpod account. You can use your GitHub account to log in.

Gitpod is a cloud-based development solution. You have a limited amount of free usage (50 hours per month) 🕒

## Step 2️⃣: Prepare Your Workspace 🚀

After creating your Gitpod account, you'll need to set up your workspace environment. With Appwrite,
Gitpod provides you with a fully equipped workspace, ready to use. Normally, you should see an
integration `github.com/appwrite/integration-for-gitpod`. You just need to select your preferred IDE and click the '
Continue' button.

You should then see a loading window. Select 'Open Browser' to open your environment in your browser
(ℹ️ **Recommended**), or in your preferred IDE.

## Step 3️⃣: Access the Appwrite Instance 🖥️

Once the instance is started, you should see your Gitpod instance. After a short wait, you should see an Appwrite
homepage in a browser. You can now proceed to set up your Appwrite instance with your application by following the steps
in [the configuration from Appwrite Cloud](/workshop/configuration/appwrite-configuration.html#etape-1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3-creation-de-votre-compte-appwrite-%F0%9F%91%A4),
