## Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Prepare Your Workspace üöÄ

After creating your Gitpod account, you'll need to set up your workspace environment. With Appwrite,
Gitpod provides you with a fully equipped workspace, ready to use. Normally, you should see an
integration `github.com/appwrite/integration-for-gitpod`. You just need to select your preferred IDE and click the '
Continue' button.

(‚ÑπÔ∏è **Recommended**), or in your preferred IDE.

homepage in a browser. You can now proceed to set up your Appwrite instance !
