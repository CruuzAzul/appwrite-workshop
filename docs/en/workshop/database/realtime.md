## The Problem Without Realtime... ‚è∞

Our AppVenture is working well; we can now insert coordinates that will lead us to the treasure. However, you need to reload the page to see them displayed after creation, and that's not ideal...

We could wait for a document to be created, and then add it to the local data, but if we want multiple users to be able to add information in parallel and have their displays stay up to date with the database, that won't be enough.

## Appwrite's Realtime ‚åö

To solve this problem, Appwrite provides a **Realtime** solution that allows you to listen to changes on the client side and update your interface accordingly. It's a system that allows us to subscribe to different channels representing various available resources, such as a collection, for example, to receive all the changes related to it via a WebSocket.

Once subscribed to a channel, each return will involve a certain number of events, such as the creation or modification of a document. You will need to sort through them to react only to the events that interest us.

## It's Your Turn üéÆ

In AppVenture, you can add this functionality by going to the `CoordinatesCardList` component and completing the `unsubscribe` function in the `useEffect`. This function is called when the component is created and will open a connection with your database to keep the list of coordinates up to date!

Feel free to use the [Appwrite documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/apis/realtime).

**1.** Subscribe to the Right Channel

The first step is to subscribe to the Appwrite client using the `subscribe` function of the Appwrite client. This function takes two parameters:

- The **channel** to which we want to subscribe, representing precisely the resource from which we want to receive real-time changes (see the [documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/apis/realtime#channels)).
- The callback function, which will be called every time an event is triggered on the chosen channel.

Here, we want to subscribe to the channel of a collection, the `Coordinates` collection that we created earlier in this workshop. It's up to you to succeed in listening to changes on this collection!

<Solution>

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const coordinatesCollection = `databases.${EnvConfig.databaseId}.collections.${EnvConfig.coordinatesCollectionId}.documents`; // [!code ++]

  return AppwriteClient.subscribe(coordinatesCollection, (response: RealtimeResponseEvent<Coordinates>) => { // [!code ++]
    // TODO: Update the AppVenture display
  }); // [!code ++]
}, []);
```

</Solution>

**2.** Listen to the Right Events

Once our function is subscribed to the right channel, we need to filter the events we want to react to.

In our case, we need to listen to two different events: the creation and the deletion of a document. In both cases, we need to update the list of coordinates in the interface. Since the application is coded in React, we use a hook to manage our state. The important thing to know is that `updatedCoordinatesList` is our list of coordinates, and `setUpdatedCoordinatesList` is the function that modifies this state by the value given as a parameter.

::: tip

In the realtime response, the different triggered events are all stored in an events array.
To simplify your life, we provide a utility function that retrieves the event type from this array, `getEventType`, which you can import from `/utils/realtime.utils.ts`.
In the same file, you'll also find an `Enum` that corresponds to the return type of the function, which you can also use:

```ts
export const enum EventType {
  CREATE = 'create',
  UPDATE = 'update',
  DELETE = 'delete',
}
```

:::

<Solution>

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const coordinatesCollection = `databases.${EnvConfig.databaseId}.collections.${EnvConfig.coordinatesCollectionId}.documents`;

  return AppwriteClient.subscribe(coordinatesCollection, (response: RealtimeResponseEvent<Coordinates>) => {
    const eventType = getEventType({ // [!code ++]
      events: response.events, // [!code ++]
    }); // [!code ++]

    switch (eventType) { // [!code ++]
      case EventType.CREATE: // [!code ++]
        setUpdatedCoordinatesList([response.payload as Coordinates, ...updatedCoordinatesList]); // [!code ++]
        break; // [!code ++]
      case EventType.DELETE: // [!code ++]
        const deletedItemId = response.payload.$id; // [!code ++]
        const filtered = updatedCoordinatesList.filter((item) => item.id !== deletedItemId); // [!code ++]
        setUpdatedCoordinatesList([...filtered]); // [!code ++]
        break; // [!code ++]
      default: // [!code ++]
        break; // [!code ++]
    }
  });
}, []);
```

</Solution>

After developing your function, try adding a coordinate in AppVenture; it should appear directly without the need to reload the page!
