We're almost there! Once we've removed the unwanted coordinates, all that's left is to find all the right coordinates in the different modules, and the treasure will be ours!

## Deleting a Document

Fortunately, a delete button is here to help you get rid of the documents we don't want. All you need to do is complete the `deleteCoordinates` function in the `coordinates.ts` file to make this button functional, and you're good to go!

<Solution>

```ts
export const deleteCoordinates = async (id: string): Promise<void> => {
  await database.deleteDocument(EnvConfig.databaseId, EnvConfig.coordinatesCollectionId, id); // [!code ++]
};
```

</Solution>

::: info
You can also modify data with the Appwrite SDK in the same way you've performed all the previous actions.

Our collection is ready to hold all the information needed to find the treasure. However, it seems that the module is not validated in AppVenture... perhaps there are some coordinates missing from our map. üó∫Ô∏è
You can move on to another module or explore the bonus part of this one to discover Realtime!
