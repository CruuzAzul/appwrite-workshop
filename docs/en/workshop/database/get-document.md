## Retrieving Documents üóÇÔ∏è

To do this, you can complete the `getCoordinatesList` function to retrieve all the coordinates from our collection so
that they can be displayed directly on AppVenture.

<Solution>

```ts
import {database} from '../../config/client.config'; // [!code ++]
import {EnvConfig} from '../../config/env.config'; // [!code ++]

export const getCoordinatesList = async (): Promise<Coordinates[]> => {
  const {documents} = await database.listDocuments<Coordinates>( // [!code ++]
    EnvConfig.databaseId, // [!code ++]
    EnvConfig.coordinatesCollectionId, // [!code ++]
  ); // [!code ++]

  return documents; // [!code ++]
};
```

</Solution>

Once the retrieval function is implemented, you should be able to see the different coordinates directly on AppVenture
üéâ

However, with all our testing, it's possible that some incorrect documents have been inserted into the database. Let's
continue our journey; maybe we'll find a solution...

<InfoBonus title="Different Data Retrieval Solutions">

In this workshop, everything goes through Appwrite's various SDKs.
However, you also have the option to access your data through two other methods:

- With REST API calls
- With GraphQL

And the best part is that interaction with Appwrite through GraphQL or REST is available for all modules, except the
authentication module for GraphQL, all without any configuration! ü§©
