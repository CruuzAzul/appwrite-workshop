## Create your first function ‚òÅÔ∏è

_Go to the function module in AppVenture_.

In our case, we have a list of destinations. Unfortunately, they're all encrypted, so it's impossible to know where to
go! As you can see, when you click on the button to add a destination, the new destination that appears is also always
encrypted, so we're going to have to develop a function to be able to decrypt the destination when it's inserted into
the database, so that we can finally know where to go!

**To do this, you'll need to create a function, and there are several ways of doing this!**

:::tabs
== CLI
**_Recommended method for this workshop_**

You can use Appwrite's CLI to create your function with the following command:

```bash
appwrite init function
```

The CLI will ask you for several parameters, such as the name, ID and runtime of your function. If you leave the ID
blank, you'll have a unique ID.

And that's it! Your function is created and will be waiting for you directly on the Appwrite console.

And when you want to redeploy it, after development for example, all you have to do is use the following command:

```bash
appwrite deploy function
```

This time, all you have to do is select the functions you want to deploy, and you're done!

Don't forget to add your API key to your function's environment variables, which you can find in the **Settings** tab.

== Quick start
You can create your function directly from the Appwrite console by going to the **Functions** page and clicking on the *
*+ Create function** button.

Then click on the **Quick start** button.

You'll be presented with a form for creating the function.
You can add the API key you created in the previous step, so that your function can access your Appwrite instance via a
server SDK.

Next, you'll need to create a GitHub repository to link your function to. This will make it easier to keep track of the
different versions of your function, so you can deploy it automatically each time you make a change to your production
branch!

== Using a template
**For this workshop, choose the `Starter function` template**.

You can create your function directly from a template provided by the Appwrite team.

To do so, simply go to the **Function** page, then to the **Templates** tab, and you'll be able to choose from 15
templates, the majority developed with the **Node.js** runtime, but some are also available in other languages.

Once you've selected the template you want, you'll be taken to a form where you can fill in the various information for
your function. You can add the API Key you created in the previous step, so that the function can access your Appwrite
instance through a server SDK.

Next, you'll need to create a github repository to link your function to. This will make it easier to keep track of the
different versions of your function, so you can deploy it automatically each time you make a change to your production
branch!
:::

As seen in the introduction, Appwrite provides several methods for creating functions, as well as a wide range of
languages and runtimes! The solutions in this workshop are written in **JS with Node.js**, but you can choose another
language if you're feeling adventurous ü•∑

## Test your function üß™

Once you've created your function, you can go to the Appwrite console to test it. To do so, go to the **Functions** tab,
click on your freshly deployed function.

You'll come to a view where you can see the status of your function, its deployment history and which of its functions
is active.

:::tip
To quickly test your function, you can click on the **Execute now** button, and a new execution will appear in the *
*Execution** tab. üöÄ
:::

Once execution is complete (usually after a few milliseconds), you can access the various function logs, in which you
should find the various function displays, _"Hello, logs!"_ and the _"Hello, errors!"_.

**That's it! Our function reacts well, and now it's time to make it do more than just display console messages ü§©**
