## Retrieving Images from Storage üñºÔ∏è

Congratulations, adventurer! You've successfully retrieved all the scattered images during your mountain ascent.
Now, it's time to display them in your application to solve the puzzle! üß©

After initializing the Appwrite SDK to allow you to communicate with the **Storage** part of Appwrite,
you'll go to the `src/api/modules/storage.ts` file and modify the `getStorageFiles` function that will retrieve
and return the storage images.

:::tip
You can use logs to display the retrieved images in your browser's console if you want to validate this first step.
:::

<Solution>

```ts
import {storage} from '@/api/config/client.config';
import {EnvConfig} from '@/api/config/env.config';

export const getStorageFiles = async (): Promise<FilesList> => {
  return await storage.listFiles(EnvConfig.storageBucketId); // [!code ++]
};
```

</Solution>

## Displaying found images üßê

Now that you've retrieved the storage images, it's time to display them in your application.
It seems like you already have the code for iterating over the retrieved images, but something is still missing to
display them. For this, we'll use one of Appwrite's methods to retrieve an image preview, which is its URL based on its
ID.

<Solution>

```ts
import {storage} from '@/api/config/client.config';
import {EnvConfig} from '@/api/config/env.config';

export const getFilesForPreviews = ({fileId}: FilePreview): URL => {
  return storage.getFilePreview( // [!code ++]
    EnvConfig.storageBucketId, // [!code ++]
    fileId, // [!code ++]
  ); // [!code ++]
};
```

</Solution>

## The Powers of Image Transformations üåü

Unfortunately, a new riddle presents itself. The images you've collected seem to be damaged; you can't see them on the
screen, even though they're there. They're not usable in their current state, but don't worry because Appwrite is here
to help you with its image transformations! ü™Ñ

You're going to modify the preview image retrieval function to apply server-side transformations to restore the damaged
images.

Change the background of the images to black to make them display properly on the screen! Once the transformations are
applied, the images should be ready for puzzle-solving and discovering the secrets of the mountain!

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Modify the Preview Retrieval Function

In the `src/api/modules/storage.ts` file, modify the `getFilesForPreviews` function to accept additional parameters that
will allow you to apply transformations to the retrieved images.

<Solution>

```ts
import {storage} from '@/api/config/client.config';
import {EnvConfig} from '@/api/config/env.config';

export const getFilesForPreviews = ({
  fileId,
  width, // [!code ++]
  height, // [!code ++]
  gravity, // [!code ++]
  quality, // [!code ++]
  borderWidth, // [!code ++]
  borderColor, // [!code ++]
  borderRadius, // [!code ++]
  opacity, // [!code ++]
  rotation, // [!code ++]
  background, // [!code ++]
  output, // [!code ++]
}: FilePreview): URL => {
  return storage.getFilePreview(
    EnvConfig.storageBucketId,
    fileId,
    width, // [!code ++]
    height, // [!code ++]
    gravity, // [!code ++]
    quality, // [!code ++]
    borderWidth, // [!code ++]
    borderColor, // [!code ++]
    borderRadius, // [!code ++]
    opacity, // [!code ++]
    rotation, // [!code ++]
    background, // [!code ++]
    output // [!code ++]
  );
};
```

</Solution>

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Modify the Function Call to Change the Background Color

In the `app/[locale]/storage/preview/page.tsx` page responsible for displaying images, you'll modify the function call
to `getFilesForPreviews`to pass a `background` parameter to change the background color of the images to black.

<Solution>

```ts
const imgSrc = getFilesForTransformedPreviews({
  fileId: file.$id,
  background: '000000', // [!code ++]
});
```

</Solution>

:::tip
As you can see with all the available parameters, Appwrite's image transformations are very powerful and allow you to do
a lot. They save you from having to perform client-side transformations, such as resizing an image for mobile view. You
can learn more about Appwrite's image transformations in
the [documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/storage/images).
