## Prepare Your Backpack for the Adventure 🎒

Appwrite's storage module is one of the most essential and powerful features of this platform. It serves as a
cornerstone for managing and storing files of all kinds, whether they are images, videos, PDF documents, or other data
types. Behind this module lies a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure that allows you to store, organize, and
manage your files with astonishing ease! 🤩

<InfoBonus title="Available Adapters ↔️">

If you are already using a file storage service, you will be pleased to know that Appwrite supports multiple storage
adapters, allowing you to connect your preferred service to Appwrite and use it as your own storage system. Appwrite
supports AWS S3, Digital Ocean Spaces, Backblaze, Akamai Object Storage, and Wasabi as storage adapters. Some of these
services can be self-hosted, just like Appwrite itself 🏠

⚠️ **Note that storage adapters are not available in the cloud version of Appwrite but only in self-hosted versions.**
